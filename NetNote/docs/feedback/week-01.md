The agenda contained a good amount of points and was well structured. You adapted the template to the specific needs of the week by focusing it on the code of conduct. I also liked how you seperated the code of conduct into the seperate points.

Feedback: 
For being the first chair you did quite good, you ensured that most of the points of the agenda were covered and managed to keep the meeting on track. For the future chairs, i would like to mention the importance that you come fully prepared for the meeting and make sure the the whole agenda is followed according to the time estimates.

Feedback: 
Some of you actively participated in the meeting, sharing your ideas and opinions regarding the components of the code of conduct. The atmosphere was quite constructive, however, I would encourage for all team members to actively participate in the discussion.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Mark: Sufficient

Since it is the first week, I will use the section to discuss the work distribution, but its imporant to note that next week, I will also assess whether the goals you set during this meeting were completed. Regarding the task distribution, I liked how you split the code of conduct between the members and how you were trying to get ahead by starting to work on a database schema this week.
