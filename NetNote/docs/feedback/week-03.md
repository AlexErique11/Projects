# Meeting


#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback:

- The agenda contained some very nice and clear points to discuss; I especially liked the round at the end were everyone discussed their tasks they have to complete for the week.
- However, the agenda was not added in time. The agenda should have been added at least 2 days before the meeting so that your team members can prepare for it
- Also, I am aware that you have fixed this now, but there were some points in the agenda that were assigned 0 minutes, which was a little confusing for me. Also, the total minute duration was not given at the time of the meeting, which is a useful to have in order to see if the meeting is on track.




#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- The notes were added shortly after the meeting and were very clear to follow
- They contained just the right amount of depth regarding the points of the agenda.
- I really liked how you included a summary of action points in the end of the notes, where you can see the main tasks to complete for the week and to which member they are assigned, which is very useful to asses your work contribution.


#### Chair performance



Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- The chair made sure the meeting stayed on track and took lead of the meeting
- You also made sure to address all points of the agenda with the required depth
- One thing to keep in mind is that as the chair your should encourage everyone to speak up and share the opinions even those members which are a little less talkative.


#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 
- The atmosphere was very constructive. Members were sharing their opinions openly and taking into account the ideas of others.
- As mentioned before, the only improvement I would like to see is that all team members are involved somewhat equally during the discussion.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- The team presented the current state of their application and made a lot of progress compared to last week.
- They have incorporated the search functionality (with highlighting), mark down functionality, priority in notes and most of the basic requirements. 
- Overall, the team is on a great track to create a working application to a high standard. I look forward to seeing your progress next week!


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team


Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- All action points from last week were implemented.
- Work distribution was done through gitlab issues and seems to be equally distributed withing the team.
- However, I would like to see some discussion from each individual and the tasks they completed during the week (maybe some time in the beginning of each meeting)
