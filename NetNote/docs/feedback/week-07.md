# Meeting


#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- The agenda was added on time and follows the template project.
- The agenda points included are chronologically structure and I especially liked the fact that you included a summary of goals for the week at the end of the agenda
- The only thing is that I feel like some points weren't really discussed in the meeting or could have been a little more discussion on them e.g issues and milestones. Make sure to use the agenda as a somewhat strict plan for the meeting.





#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

- The minutes go into quite bit of depth and contain the most important information that was discussed in the meeting.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
