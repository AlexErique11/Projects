# Meeting


#### Agenda 


Quick Summary:Good

Feedback:

- I really liked some of the points you included in the agenda, especially under the 'Talking points' in the agenda as they sparked some very nice conversation
- In the future I would encourage everyone to follow the template structure a little more, since some points were missing (e.g. announcements by TA, showing the app to TA...)


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Insufficient

Feedback: 

- The minutes from the previous week were added shortly after the meeting which allowed other members to quickly look at them.
- However there were a few points in the agenda which contain barely no notes and in general, very few notes were added to the agenda.
- To improve,  I would ensure that more notes are included for the agenda points and also make sure that if you make concrete agreements, make sure you assign them to a concrete member.


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- I think you did a nice job of leading the meeting especially with the fact that you were one of the few members that were online
- however, I feel like you were not really prepared for the meeting; by this I mean that you were not fully sure how to address your agenda points. For example, at the beginning you first wanted your members to discuss the tasks completed, but then changed your mind and decided to do this whilst showing the app, which was a little chaotic to follow. I would encourage to split these two points in the future(e.g. 1. discuss tasks doene by each member, 2. display app to the TA )



#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- I love how despite having the hybrid setup in place everyone contributed equally to the discussion.
- Some microphone issues were experienced and solved fairly quickly, but overall the atmosphere was contructive and members were displaying their opinions openly.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- Quite a bit of progress was made in the Multi-collection + embedded files features. 
- However, whilst you were displaying the app, you were able to find quite a lot of bugs with these new incorporations(e.g. tags + search combined etc...)
- It would be great to see these get fixed as well as some fully functional features in the future, but overall you are on a good track for creating a high standard app.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- Everyone seems to have completed the action list from last week which is shown by the progress made in the app.
- I really enjoyed how the team had a discussion in the end explaining the tasks they will have to complete this week.
- However, I would also like to see this at the beggining(were each of you explain what you've done last week), I am aware you tried this, but it was a bit hard to keep up whilst you were displaying the app.
