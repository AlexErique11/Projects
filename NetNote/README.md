# CSEP Project Team 60
## How to run
To run the template project from the command line, you either need to have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) installed on your local system (`mvn`) or you need to use the Maven wrapper (`mvnw`). You can then execute

	mvn clean install

to package and install the artifacts for the three subprojects. Afterwards, you can run ...

	cd server
	mvn spring-boot:run

to start the server or ...

	cd client
	mvn javafx:run

to run the client. Please note that the server needs to be running, before you can start the client.

Once this is working, you can try importing the project into your favorite IDE.

## Keybord Shortcuts

The app is fully navigatable using only the Keybord. For full navigations the user must use the arrows ‚Üê‚Üë‚Üì‚Üí.
If he wants to press a button or open a dropdown menu the user can do that by pressing ENTER ‚Üµ.

Here are the shortcuts for fast navigation:
- ESC puts focus on the search bar
- C puts focus on the collection dropdown menu (If you are not currently typing in the descirption box or editing a note name)
- = or + create a new note/collection (depending on the scene you are currently on)(Does not work when in all collections)
- DELETE (‚ê° button not backspace) deletes the selected note/collection (depending on the scene you are currently on) (Does not work when in all collections)
- CTRL + Z undoes the last operation

You can clear tags using only the keyboard. Navigate to the first dropdown tag menu. Click one time the right arrow ->. After that press enter.

## How to start/create new servers

- To start more that one server you have to create another configuration in intelij. 
- Every configuration should include the port specified in the form of -Dserver.port=8080 and the profile name which should be equal to the name from properties file. ex server1, server2, server3
- To create a new server add it to the servers.txt file  in commons an create a new configuration following the format of the already created ones.
For every server the new configuration is needed: like application-server1.properties: the file should include the port and the name of the server in the configuration file
- For the first three servers the property files are already included and the only needed thing is to create the right intelliJ configuration with VM variables and active profile name.

## Implemented features

Our team has implemented all of the features from the Product Backlog.

1. Basic features: you can navigate them thought the buttons and search bar on top. We have also added the option to move notes up and down
to ensure a nice and logical state of the app. The collection menu serves as a manual refresh button. By clicking it you ensure that everything is up to date but there is no need for taht becasue everything is automatically updated. 
2. Multi collection: The drop down menu on top of the search bar shows the current collectio and the person can switch collections from it.
The button on the right of it opens a new scene. From there the user can create/delete/rename collections. 
- Bonus feature: He can also change servers. Each server is connected to different collections connected to different notes. See above(How to start/create new server). Status of the server is shown when selecting a server.
3. Embeded files: The üìé allow you to add files to the note and see them in the preview. On the bottom you can see all of your files. You can rename then
and delete them from there. 
-Bonus feature we implemented: the ability to move files from one note to another using the button next in the files menu.
4. Interconnected content: The empty drop down menu above the title is for tags. Add tags to the notes and they will appear there. If there is more than 1
tag new boxes will show up after you have filled the first one. 
-Bonus feature we have implemented: An algorithm that searches and tells you the closest word to yours. If you try to reference a note using `[[noteName]]`
but there is no note with the correct name and you hover your mouse over the red name on the markdown you will get the closest name to your noteName. If there
is no note that is close you will not be able to resolve.
5. Automated Change Synchronizatio: Implemented! 
6. Live Language switch: Use the top right drop down menu to change languages.
- Bonus: Buttons and labels change size depending on language to ensure maximal usability. Markdown tutorial in webview is also translated! We support 3 fully funcational languages.


## Usability:

We have implemented 20+ warnings/errors, some harder to get than others but they are there. 
Some Examples are: 
- Trying to clear tags when there are none.
- Trying to add notes while you are filtering by tag
- Trying to delete/Move to a different collection without having selected a note
- Trying to move notes up and down while searching
- Much more

Multivisualisation elemets:

- status bar for 3+ features at least
- Collection status update in collection scene (All changes saved/Unsaved chnaged)
- Flags for each language when you click on the languge menuButton 
- Search bar icon next to searchBar

We have implemented a lot of informational popups:

- a status bar on top of the note that presents colored text when you create/delete/move up down to the other collection a note and when you swith a colelction
- When you replace a reference it gives you an information popup
- some more informational popups

We have also implemented confirmation popups:

- trying to delete a note or collection
- Trying to move a note to a different collection
- Trying to move a note with the same name to a collection where the name already exists

## WebView color:
We have implemented the option for the user to include his own CSS for webview.

This CSS will be used for the webview only.
If the user will leave this file empty, the style will be automatically set to the scene's style.
